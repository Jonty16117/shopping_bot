## What is shopping_bot? 
shopping_bot is a script written completely in python that can automatically add shopping items to your cart. 

## Why use shopping_bot? 
shopping_bot is primarily made for the flash sale offers offered by websites like flipkart and amazon that sell products such as smartphones which become out of stock very quickly (usually within a matter of seconds). This script will maximise your chance of buying such items. 

## Requirements
Following are the things you need to run this script: 
1. Python >= 3.6 
2. [Selenium](https://pypi.org/project/selenium/) 
3. [Chromedriver](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads) (Check your chrome version and download the appropriate version of Chromedriver) 

## Setting up 
1. After downloading Chromedriver, place this ".exe" file at the location "C:/Program Files (x86)/" 
2. Open config.ini and enter your details 
3. Now you are ready to go. Just open terminal (cmd), go to the folder of this project directory and run "python bot.py" 
4. Select the appropriate options 
5. Done!! 

## Note
Currently this script only adds the item to the cart, and the user have to place the rest of the order manually. This feature of auto-order will be add in future. Also the websites that are supported currently are: 
1. Flipkart 
2. Amazon

Support for more websites coming soon... 

Happy Shopping
